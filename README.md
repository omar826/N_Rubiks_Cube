# N*N*N Rubik's Cube in Lean 4  

## Overview  
This project aims to model an **n × n × n Rubik's Cube** in **Lean 4**.  

Some of the code in this project has been adapted from the **3 × 3 × 3 implementation** in [vihdzp/rubik-lean4](https://github.com/vihdzp/rubik-lean4), which is licensed under **Apache-2.0**.  

## Project Goals  
- Model an **n × n × n Rubik's Cube** in **Lean 4**.  
- Display the state of the cube dynamically for use cases.  
- Formally **state and prove** solvability conditions for an **n × n × n** cube.  

## Extended Goals  
- Implement an **algorithm to solve a 2 × 2 × 2 cube**.  
- Formally **prove the correctness** of the solving algorithm.  
- Formally **prove the optimality** of the solving algorithm.
